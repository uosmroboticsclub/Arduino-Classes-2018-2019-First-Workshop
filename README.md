# Arduino-Classes-2018-First-Workshop

# Introduction :laughing:
Hey guys Hank here! Welcome to UoSM Robotics Club's First Workshop! If you have any questions please ask!

# There are 3 main folders here, LED, POV (Persistence of Vision) and Buzzer!
1.Folder LED contains code for 3 types of arduino files for LED basics such as for loops and while loops.
2.Folder POV contains two types of Persistence of Vision, one is 8 LED array and the other is 13 LED array. Both works with the same concept.
3.Folder Buzzer is a bonus code given by me :) just run the code and read the comments or find me if you want to know some special effects!

# Getting Started
1. Download the zip code of this file, then extract it.
1. Alternatively you can fork this project and open in Visual Studios and use the Team Explorer in Visual Studios to help you clone the entire project. Not recommended for beginners. Please consult help if unsure.
2. Open the code in Arduino IDE, select your COM port and upload.

# Contribute
1. Any other ways we can play with the LED patterns?
2. Is there a way to generalize an array for regardless how many LED is present? 
3. How do I create the songs I want to play myself?

#HAPPY CODING!!! :heart:
